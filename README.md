# sam3x8e-hal
This is an attempted hal implementation for the sam3x8e microcontroller used in Arduino Due in accordance with embedded-hal traits.

Very useful (necessary, even) in understanding this library is the Atmel/Microchip Datasheet for the SAM3X chips.
The latest one at the time of writing was found here:
